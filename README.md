# PlatonicSolids
This repository uses Processing.org software to display 3d structures representing the 5 platonic solids and some strucures derived from them. The structures are stored in the PLY format and the program readply.pde is able to load and visualize a general PLY format structure of upto 200000 vertices and 1000000 faces. The PeasyCam package it incorparates affords the opportinity to explore the structure from any angle and different distances.
